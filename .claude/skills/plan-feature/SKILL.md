Follow CLAUDE.md rules.

**Output file:** `docs/plan-features/{$ARGUMENTS.name}_FEATURE.md` (uppercase)

## Ultra Think Strategy

Ultra think before each phase transition:
- After exploration results: reflect on completeness before planning
- Before writing spec: consider architecture, edge cases, future maintainability
- After validation: ensure the plan is comprehensive and actionable

---

## 1. GATHER REQUIREMENTS

Ask user for:
- Detailed feature description
- Mockups/screenshots if available
- Business rules and edge cases
- Integrations with existing features

Do not proceed until requirements are clear.

---

## 1.5 CLARIFY DETAILS

Use AskUserQuestion to clarify before exploration:

### Must clarify (if not specified)
- Error messages for user-facing failures?
- Default values for new fields?
- Validation rules?
- What triggers state changes?

### UX Decisions (if not specified)
- What happens on success? (toast, redirect, refresh?)
- What happens on error?
- Confirmation dialogs needed?

### Permissions (if not specified)
- Who can perform each action?
- RLS policy rules?

Do not proceed until critical details are clarified.

---

## 2. EXPLORE (PARALLEL)

Launch agents based on feature scope (single message, parallel execution):

| Need | Agent | Prompt |
|------|-------|--------|
| Backend | explore-codebase | "Find all [feature] related code in backend/ - entities, usecases, repos, handlers" |
| Frontend | explore-codebase | "Find all [feature] related code in frontend/src/ - components, hooks, types, pages" |
| Database | explore-db | "dev - Find tables related to [feature], check schema and relationships" |
| Library | explore-docs | "[library] [specific feature] documentation" |
| External | websearch | "[topic] best practices 2025" |

---

## 2.5 POST-EXPLORATION CHECK

After agents return, verify:
1. Database info complete? If not -> launch explore-db
2. Library docs complete? If not -> launch explore-docs

---

## 3. VALIDATE ARCHITECTURE

Display architecture plan:

```markdown
## Architecture Plan - [Feature Name]

### Database
- Tables to create: [list with columns]
- Tables to modify: [changes]
- RLS policies needed

### Backend (Go Clean Architecture)
- Entities: [list]
- Usecases: [list with descriptions]
- Handlers: [endpoints]
- Code to reuse: [from exploration]

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Types, Components, Hooks, Pages
- Code to reuse: [from exploration]

### Libraries / Best Practices
- [from exploration]
```

Ask with AskUserQuestion: "Validate this architecture?"
- "Validate"
- "Modify"

---

## 4. WRITE SPEC FILE

After validation, write complete spec to `docs/plan-features/{$ARGUMENTS.name}_FEATURE.md`.

Use the template structure from [templates/feature-spec-template.md](templates/feature-spec-template.md).

Structure:
1. Overview (objective, summary, tech stack)
2. Context and Motivation
3. Functional Specifications (detailed behavior, rules, edge cases)
4. Technical Architecture (existing files to modify, new files to create)
5. Configuration (`app.yaml` for thresholds, limits, feature flags - NO hardcoded values)
6. Database (migrations, columns, RLS policies)
7. Backend Implementation (phases: Domain -> Infrastructure -> Application -> Presentation)
8. Frontend Implementation (phases: Types/API -> Hooks -> Components -> Pages)
9. Execution Plan (checkboxes for each task)
10. Important Notes (compatibility, performance, security)

### Backend Phase Rules
- Order: Domain -> Infrastructure -> Application -> Presentation
- Max 5 items per phase - split if more
- Separate CRUD usecases from business logic usecases
- Each phase must compile independently

---

## 5. DELIVER

- Confirm file created
- Summarize the phases
- Indicate next steps:
  - `/dev spec=docs/plan-features/[name]_FEATURE.md phase=1`
  - `/dev spec=docs/plan-features/[name]_FEATURE.md phase=8`

---

## Rules

- **EXPLORE FIRST** - parallel exploration before the plan
- **CONTEXT IS KEY** - spec must be detailed enough for a new session
- **VALIDATE** - user validation before writing spec
- **CHECKBOXES** - execution plan with checkboxes to track progress
